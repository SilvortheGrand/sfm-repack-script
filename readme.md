# Silvor's batch repacking script
This script is quite simple. It takes your standard tf2 maps and repackages them for SFM. This can normally be done [like this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480267373), but the process is pretty time consuming and I couldn't be bothered to paste the same command a million times, so I made a script that does it automatically.

### Installation
All you've got to do is paste the contents of the zip into the `Team Fortress 2/bin/` folder. 

### Batch exporting
After installing, there should now be a folder called `RepackagedMaps` and inside of that is a file called `.RepackAllMaps.ps1`. Copy all the maps you want to repack into this folder. You can then right click on the script and select `Run with PowerShell`.
